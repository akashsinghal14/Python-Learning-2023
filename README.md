# Python-Learning-2023
It's just a placeholder where keeping my learnig. Goal is to learn python and document whatever is in progress or accomplished. I could have used evernote for this, but I need something which can use for coding in future and could be accessible so I'm documenting everything here. I might refine this in future more.

### Following videos first from [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRMmlo_Uqcs&list=PLIhvC56v63ILPDA2DQBv0IKzqsWTZxCkp)
After two videos I created a code like below and executed in replit.com, code is- refer file of python [firstcode_Jan20.py](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/firstcode_Jan20.py)

### Few files I created by myself after learnign few funtionlaties of python, to automate few things for my project. Below two files I created-
1. [delcg.py](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/delcg.py) - to delete all files except coding files of python in metioned folder
2. [renamecg.py](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/renamecg.py) - to rename all files except coding files


### [Website Login](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/tree/main/website_login)
This folder contains the code of python selenium, python GIT and couple of OS library function like deleting file, renaming it and replcing it in other folder. I created this code to automate my daily work and reduce the redundant work we do as a team.
This folder has two files one is [logindetails.yml](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/website_login/logindetails.yml) which contain credentials of site to login. Other is [login_multiple.py](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/website_login/login_multiple.py) which has all the code described above.
