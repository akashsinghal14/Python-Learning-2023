# Python-Learning-2023
It's just a placeholder where keeping my learnig. Goal is to learn python and document whatever is in progress or accomplished. I could have used evernote for this, but I need something which can use for coding in future and could be accessible so I'm documenting everything here. I might refine this in future more.

### Following videos first from [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRMmlo_Uqcs&list=PLIhvC56v63ILPDA2DQBv0IKzqsWTZxCkp)
After two videos I created a code like below and executed in replit.com, code is- refer file of python [firstcode_Jan20.py](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/firstcode_Jan20.py)

### Few files I created by myself after learnign few funtionlaties of python, to automate few things for my project. Below two files I created-
1. [delcg.py](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/delcg.py) - to delete all files except coding files of python in metioned folder
2. [renamecg.py](https://github.com/akashsinghal14/Python-Learning-2023/blob/main/renamecg.py) - to rename all files except coding files
